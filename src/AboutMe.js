        <p>I am currently working as a Teacher three days a week and a Swimming Pool Tiler two days a week. I am a life long learner and am very excited to continue to develop my skills in this field. I am nearing the completion of a Coding Bootcamp. This is a space where I will display my projects as I continue to develop my coding skills and knowledge.</p>
